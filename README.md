# MuseumApp
The MuseumApp is the web app that is being designed in the context of my master thesis to communicate with the interactions running on Raspberry Pi's and a booking system. This web app has the main responsability of orchestrating the interactions in order to create a personalized visits with different interactions.  Note that, since this web app will be deployed in the museum of IST-Taguspark, it uses the same web interface (Peddy Room System) of a project from another student.
